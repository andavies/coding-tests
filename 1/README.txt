Write a function called deepClone which takes an object and creates a copy of it. e.g. {name: "Paddy", address: {town: "Lerum", country: "Sweden"}} -> {name: "Paddy", address: {town: "Lerum", country: "Sweden"}}

Code should be in JavaScript/NodeJS without the use of any 3rd party libraries or frameworks.
